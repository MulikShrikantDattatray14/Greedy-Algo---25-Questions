Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit.

note :-

So the problems where choosing locally optimal also leads to global solution are the best fit for Greedy.

it is an approach to solve problems by making locally optimal choices at each step.
